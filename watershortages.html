<h2 id="home">Water Scarcity</h2>
<p>Water covers 70% of our planet, and it is easy to think that it will always be plentiful. However, freshwater—the stuff we drink, bathe in, irrigate our farm fields with—is incredibly rare. <b>Only 3% of the world’s water is fresh water</b>, and two-thirds of that is tucked away in frozen glaciers or otherwise unavailable for our use.As a result, some 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water, and a total of 2.7 billion find water scarce for at least one month of the year. <b>Inadequate sanitation</b> is also a problem for 2.4 billion people—they are exposed to diseases, such as <b>cholera</b> and <b>typhoid fever</b>, and other <b>water-borne illnesses</b>. Two million people, mostly children, die each year from <b>diarrheal diseases</b> alone.<br><br> Many of the water systems that keep ecosystems thriving and feed a growing human population have become stressed. <b>Rivers</b>, <b>lakes</b> and <b>aquifers</b> are drying up or becoming too polluted to use. More than half the world’s wetlands have disappeared. <b>Agriculture</b> consumes more water than any other source and wastes much of that through inefficiencies. Climate change is altering patterns of weather and water around the world, causing shortages and droughts in some areas and floods in others. At the current consumption rate, this situation will only get worse. <b>By 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages</b>. And ecosystems around the world will suffer even more.</p>
<br>
<h2>So What Causes Water Scarcity?</h2>
<p>The human population has successfully harnessed many of the world’s natural waterways—building dams, water wells, vast irrigation systems and other structures that have allowed civilizations to grow and thrive. But water systems are increasingly stressed, and some rivers, lakes and aquifers are drying up.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
    <td>- <b>Pollution</b><br> Water pollution comes from many sources including <b>pesticides</b> and <b>fertilizers</b> that wash away from <b>farms</b>, <b>untreated human wastewater</b>, and <b>industrial waste</b>. Even groundwater is not safe from pollution, as many pollutants can leach into underground aquifers. Some effects are immediate, as when harmful bacteria from human waste contaminate water and make it unfit to drink or swim in. In other instances—such as <b>toxic substances</b> from <b>industrial processes</b> may take years to build up in the environment and food chain before their effects are fully recognized.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
    <td>- <b>Agriculture</b><br> Agriculture uses 70% of the world’s accessible freshwater, but some 60% of this is wasted due to <b>leaky irrigation systems</b>, <b>inefficient application methods</b> as well as the <b>cultivation of crops</b> that are too thirsty for the environment in which they are grown. This wasteful use of water is drying out <b>rivers</b>, <b>lakes</b> and <b>underground aquifers</b>. Many countries that produce large amounts of food—including <b>India</b>, <b>China</b>, <b>Australia</b>, <b>Spain</b> and the <b>United States</b>—have reached or are close to reaching their water resource limits. Added to these thirsty crops are the fact that agriculture also generates considerable <b>freshwater pollution</b> – both through <b>fertilizers</b> as well as <b>pesticides</b> – all of which affect both humans and other species.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
    <td>- <b>Population Growth</b><br>In the last 50 years, <b>the human population has more than doubled</b>. This rapid growth— with its accompanying <b>economic development</b> and <b>industrialization</b>—has transformed <b>water ecosystems</b> around the world and resulted in a massive loss of <b>biodiversity</b>. Today, <b>41% of the world’s population lives in river basins that are under water stress</b>. Concern about water availability grows as freshwater use continues at unsustainable levels. Furthermore, these new faces also need <b>food</b>, <b>shelter</b>, and <b>clothing</b>, thus resulting in additional pressure on freshwater through the production of <b>commodities</b> and <b>energy</b>.</td>
