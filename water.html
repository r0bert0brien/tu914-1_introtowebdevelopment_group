<h3>Interactive Graph of Water Levels from 1980-2009</h3>
<h2>Rising Water Levels</h2>
<p><b>Global warming</b> causes rising sea levels in two ways. First, as the ocean warms, it takes up more space. That alone has caused half of the sea level rise in the past century. Second, a warmer temperature melts <b>Greenland's</b> ice sheets and the polar ice caps. Between 2002 and 2016, <b>Antarctica</b> lost 125 gigatons of ice annually. It contributed 0.013 inches of sea level rise per year. Most of this loss occurred in the <b>West Antarctic Ice Sheet</b>.<b>Antarctica</b> holds 90% of the world's ice. If it all melted, sea levels would rise 200 feet.<br><br>
The rate of ice sheet melting is accelerating. Between 1992 and 2017, <b>Antarctica</b> shed 3 trillion tons of ice. It increased sea levels by three-tenths of an inch. But 40% of that occurred during the last five years, from 2012 to 2017.Looked at another way, Antarctic melting has tripled since 2007. At that rate, it will increase sea levels another six inches, or 15 centimeters, by 2100. <b>Andrew Shepherd</b>, a professor of earth observation at the <b>University of Leeds</b>, said that translates into flooding in <b>Brooklyn</b> around 20 times a year. Even more recently, an additional concern has been added. Between 2010 and 2016, the Antarctic grounding line has receded 600 feet per year. The grounding line is the last place where the ice meets bedrock. A receding line means warmer ocean water is melting the underside of the glacier while a warmer air temperature attacks the top layers. It creates a river under the glaciers that ferries them more quickly into the ocean. That could raise sea level another 10 feet by 2100. It's enough to put FDR Drive and 1st Avenue on the Upper East Side in Manhattan underwater.<br><br> During the same period, <b>Greenland</b> lost 280 gigatons of ice per year. It's melting at the fastest rate in the past 450 years. The melting ice added 0.03 inches each year to rising sea levels. The worst losses occurred along the <b>West Greenland</b> coast. If the <b>Greenland</b> ice sheet melts completely, it would raise sea levels by 16 feet to 23 feet. That's enough to put <b>New Orleans</b>, <b>Miami</b>, and <b>Amsterdam</b> underwater. The loss of polar ice also affects the many species that live there. <b>Polar bears</b> are just one of the 17 species that will go extinct as a result.</p>
<br>
<h2>Predictions for the Future</h2>
<p>Timing is critical. A five-year delay in addressing climate change would increase sea levels by another 7.8 inches. That's almost as much as the 8.9-inch increase that's occurred since 1880. Here's a timeline of what will happen if nothing is done.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
    <td>- By 2033, rising sea levels will flood 4,000 miles of fiber optic cables that deliver the internet and telephone services. Relocating the cables would be expensive and only buy a little time. At first in the US, <b>New York</b>, <b>Miami</b>, and <b>Seattle</b> would be affected the most. Over time, everyone will be impacted by a disruption in these services.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
    <td>- By 2038, 170 U.S. coastal cities and towns will be “chronically inundated” according to the <b>Union of Concerned Scientists</b>. They will see 10% of their area flooded at least twice a month. By 2100, more than half of the communities along the <b>Eastern Seaboard</b> and <b>Gulf Coast</b> will experience it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
    <td>- By 2045, another study found that 300,000 coastal properties will be flooded 26 times a year. The value of that real estate is $136 billion. </td>
        </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>- By 2100, that number will rise to $1 trillion. At most risk are homes in <b>Miami</b>, <b>New York's Long Island</b>, and the <b>San Francisco Bay area</b>. For example, <b>San Francisco</b> would experience $62 billion in property damage by a four-foot rise in sea levels. It would also put the headquarters of <b>Facebook</b> and <b>Facebook</b> underwater. </td>
        </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>- <b>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</b> predicted sea levels will rise between one and two feet by 2100. That's 52 cm to 98 cm. The <b>IPCC</b> made this forecast in 2007. A two-foot rise would flood tens of millions of people living in low-lying areas. It would swamp many U.S. East Coast cities </td>

<h2>Potential Solutions to the Problem</h2>
    <p>There are three types of solutions to sea level rise. The most widely-discussed are coping solutions. Coastal cities are installing drainage systems and building up seawalls. Island populations are moving. Tourists are flocking to visit popular vacation spots, like the <b>Maldives</b> before they are underwater. In <b>Boston</b>, developers are planning ahead. <b>Skanska Commercial Development</b> constructed an elliptical office tower designed to withstand fierce wind storms. The building's electrical infrastructure is located 40 feet above the 100-year floodplain. It also has a 40,000-gallon water reclamation tank, and a raised ground floor. But coping solutions don't address the root cause of global warming. Nations are focused on the second type of solution, <b>reducing future greenhouse gas emissions</b>. They are switching from <b>fossil fuels</b> to <b>clean alternatives</b>. These include <b>solar energy</b>, <b>wind energy</b>, and <b>geothermal energy sources</b>.​They are instituting carbon taxes to raise the cost of burning carbon. <b>Carbon emissions</b> trading rewards businesses that adhere to carbon caps. <br> The third solution is the most critical, but less widely discussed. Existing greenhouse gases must be removed from the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration captures and stores CO2 underground. To meet the <b>Paris Agreement</b> goal, 10 billion tons a year must be removed by 2050 and 100 billion tons by 2100. In 2018, only 60 million tons of carbon was sequestered according to <b>Princeton University</b>'s <b>Professor Steven Pacala</b>.<br> One of the easiest solutions is to plant trees and other vegetation to halt deforestation. The world's 3 trillion trees store 400 gigatons of carbon. There is room to plant another 1.2 trillion trees in vacant land across the earth. That would absorb an additional 1.6 gigatons of carbon. <b>The Nature Conservancy </b>estimated that this would only cost $10 per ton of CO2 absorbed. <b>California</b> is planting trees to prevent flooding. <b>Seattle</b> encourages developers to add rooftop gardens or walls covered by vegetation to new building projects.<br><br> <b>Restoring peatland and wetland areas</b> is another low-cost carbon sequestration solution. <b>Peatlands</b> are the compressed remains of plants in waterlogged areas. They contain 550 gigatons of carbon. Governments must develop plans to identify, conserve, and restore the world's peatlands. Second, farmers must manage their soil better. For example, they could reduce plowing which releases carbon into the atmosphere. Instead, they could plant carbon-absorbing plants such as <b>daikon</b>. The roots break up the earth and become fertilizer when they die. The government can subsidize these methods to make them cost-effective with traditional methods that rely on fertilizers.<br><br>Third, power plants can efficiently use carbon capture and storage because CO2 makes up 5% to 10% of their emissions. The government should subsidize the research as it did with solar and wind energy. It would only cost $900 million, far less than the $15 billion <b>Congress</b> spent on <b>Hurricane Harvey</b> disaster relief.</p>
