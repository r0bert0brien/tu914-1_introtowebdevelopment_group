<h2>Butterflies</h2>
<p>Butterflies are one of the instects at most risk due to the ever changing conditions caused by
Climate Change. A number of traits make them vulnerable to a changing climate. Like most butterflies, 
monarchs in particular, are highly sensitive to weather and climate: They depend on environmental cues 
(temperature) to trigger reproduction, migration, and hibernation. By the climate changing from what they 
think it should be, this will lead to delayed process which may be disasterous or even completly skipping 
processes. </p>
<h2>Bees</h2>
<p>Bees are without a doubt the most important instect on the planet. Without bees flowers and most plants would 
die out, which would lead to most things following in that. Climate change has effected them in the same way as 
the butterflies. Bees use tempreature to judge when to do things like pollinate. If they are not in sync with plants, 
The plants will die out as the bees were unaware it was time to pollinate. Climate change is also causing habitat 
loss as bees fail to migrate to cooler areas and establish new hives. A recent study on bumblebee migrations found 
that bee territories have shrunk by nearly 200 miles in North America and Europe. Some studies also show that higher 
tempratures alos led to higher illness transmission rates with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosema_ceranae" target="_blank">Nosema ceranae</a>
being the biggest concern.</p>

<h2>Flies</h2>
<p>Flies have had mixed reactions with Climate change and tempreatures chnaging. Some flies have developed what is called heat hardening 
and have almost evolved to deal with heat slowly rising. This however leads to them struggling when it is cooler. On the other side, many 
just can't handle the heat. Climate change has lead to many flies suffering what is called "heat death". This doesn't occur overnight 
however, insects and flies in particular have nowhere to hide from Climate change. This leads to exposure to high heat over long periods 
of time leading to the previously mentioned "heat death". </p>
