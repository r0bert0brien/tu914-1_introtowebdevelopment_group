<h2>Coral Reefs</h2>
<p>Coral reefs are some of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. Thousands of species of corals have been discovered; some live in warm, shallow, tropical seas and others in the cold, dark depths of the ocean. Because of the diversity of life found in the habitats created by corals, reefs are often called the "rainforests of the sea." About 25% of the ocean's fish depend on healthy coral reefs. Fishes and other organisms shelter, find food, reproduce, and rear their young in the many nooks and crannies formed by corals. </p>
<br>

<h2>Why Are They Important</h2>
<p>70% of the oxygen you breathe comes from the ocean. Reefs are the foundation of ocean health and without them, marine life would cease to exist. No coral reefs, means no oxygen from the ocean. </p>
<p>Coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and give us a free playground. They are also are a source of food and new medicines. Over half a billion people depend on reefs for food, income, and protection. Fishing, diving, and snorkeling on and near reefs add hundreds of millions of dollars to local businesses. The net economic value of the worldâ€™s coral reefs is Estimated to be tens of billions of U.S. dollars per year. These ecosystems are culturally important to indigenous people around the world.</p>

<br>
<h2>What Is Happening </h2>
<p>Unfortunately, coral reef ecosystems are severely threatened. Threats are caused by people, including pollution, sedimentation, unsustainable fishing practices, single-use plastics, chemicals found in sun screens, and climate change, which is raising ocean temperatures and causing ocean acidification. Many of these threats can stress corals, leading to coral bleaching and possible death, while others cause physical damage to these delicate ecosystems.</p>
<p> During the 2014-2017 coral bleaching event, unusually warm waters affected 70% of coral reef ecosystems worldwide. Some areas were hit particularly hard, like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, where hundreds of miles of coral were bleached.</p>
